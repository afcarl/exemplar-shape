# exemplar-shape

This is a MATLAB implementation of "Interpretable Exemplar-Based Shape Classification Using Constrainted Sparse Linear Models" by Sigurdsson, Yang, Tran, and Prince.

This repository also includes a simple implementation of the Non-Negative OMP algorithm by Bruckstein et al. from the paper "On the Uniqueness of Nonnegative Sparse Solutions to Underdetermined Systems of Equations".
